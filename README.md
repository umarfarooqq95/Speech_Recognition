# Speech_Recognition
Speech recognition is the ability of a machine or program to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert 
them to a machine-readable format. 
Rudimentary speech recognition software has a limited vocabulary of words and phrases, 
and it may only identify these if they are spoken very clearly.

Above given files can be refferenced while understanding the different concepts like
1. In audio_preprocessing.ipynb and Modelling_audio_classification, we used techniques to extract mfcc features from audio files
and implemented convolutional neural network on it for all classification. The data used for this classification was audio files of different 
musical instruments.

2.In plot_ICA files, dicusses ICA the different differentiate speaks in a audio files.

3.Algorithm like Cocktail-Party can be used for speech tagging. Advance new method which uses CNNs can als be used for better accuracy.
