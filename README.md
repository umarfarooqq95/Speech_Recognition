# Speech_Recognition
Speech recognition is the ability of a machine or program to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert 
them to a machine-readable format. 
Rudimentary speech recognition software has a limited vocabulary of words and phrases, 
and it may only identify these if they are spoken very clearly.

Above given files can be referenced to understand the different concepts related to the project.
1. In audio_preprocessing.ipynb and Modelling_audio_classification, we used digital signal processing technique to extract mfcc features from audio files
and implemented convolutional neural network on it for all phoneme classification. The data used for this classification was audio files of different musical instruments.

2. In plot_ICA files, dicusses ICA the different differentiate speaks in a audio files.

3. Algorithm like Cocktail-Party can be used for speech tagging. Advance new method which uses CNNs can als be used for better accuracy.

4. File named Training_40_30k uses WSJ phoneme data from Prof.Bhiksha Raj sir class. We applied a method called contexting to increase accuracy during classification of different phonemes.

5. Read this blog to understand the concept of MFCC. http://practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/guide-mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients-mfccs/

6. This lecture series from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research covers the theory behind different concepts. 
It also dicusses algorithms like Hidden Markovs Model and RNN for word prediction.
